# WeatherDashboard
Challenge 6 was meant to show my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills that I have acquired.  When you input the name of the city, the user should see the city name, temperature, wind , and humidity directly under the Weather Dashboard header.  Users will also receive the weather information for the next five days.  The name of the searched cities will be saved and appear below the search bar so they can click the City button and retrieve the weather info for the previously searched city.

## Features
Notes: There are notes throughout the code I used to help label and understand what was done.

Collaberation: I have given credit to those who assisted me on the project.

Xpert Learning Assistant
    This is an AI that was specifically designed to assist students like myself in this Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It did assist me with detailed questions I had with my code. 

ChatGPT 3.5
    I used this AI to confirm the information I was given by the learning assistant. I also used it to ask questions if I was still not able to understand what Expert Learning Assistant was telling me and help me understand why parts of my code was not functioning properly.
